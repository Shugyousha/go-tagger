contribution
to
Goodwill
will
mean
more
than
you
may
know
.
To
help
you
see
how
much
your
contribution
means
,
I
'm
sharing
with
you
The
words
of
people
who
have
lived
Goodwill
's
mission
.
We
want
you
to
Know
why
your
support
of
Goodwill
is
so
important
.
Your
gift
to
Goodwill
is
important
because
people
with
physical
and
Mental
disabilities
sometimes
need
an
extra
hand
to
know
the
pride
that
comes
with
work
.

was
sad
when
I

n't
go

the
snack
bar
to
buy

Now
I
can
buy
a
soda
and
spend
money

I
like

I

turning
welfare

into
tax

just
makes
sense

&quot;_''When
I

came

The

Cornell_NNPEach
year
,
we
help
thousands
of
people
who
face
tremendous
obstacles
.
Their
one
common
goal
:
they
all
want
to
work
.
A
robust
economy
helps
by
providing
job
opportunities
,
but
to
be
honest
,
most
of
the
people
who
are
n't
working
today
are
quite
simply
the
ones
who
face
the
greatest
obstacles
.
The
kinds
of
services
we
provide
help
people
deal
with
obstacles
like
health
care
,
transportation
and
child
care
-
problems
that
are
big
enough
on
their
own
without
being
compounded
by
factors
like
physical
and
mental
disabilities
,
illiteracy
and
lack
of
job
skills
.
Last
year
,
Goodwill
helped
3
,
300
people
find
jobs
that
increased
their
self-sufficiency
.
Your
gift
to
Goodwill
will
be
used
directly
to
support
services
that
will
help
even
more
find
jobs
.
Right
now
,
there
are
thousands
of
people
who
do
not
know
what
it
feels
like
to
support
themselves
.
You
can
help
them
to
know
that
feeling
.
Please
help
Goodwill
and
help
people
find
jobs
.

McClelland
President
Dear
,
A
few
months
ago
you
received
a
letter
from
me
telling
the
success
stories
of
people
who
got
jobs
with
Goodwill
's
help
.
Here
's
another
story
of
success
from
what
might
seem
like
an
unlikely
source
:
Goodwill
's
controller
,
Juli
.
She
tells
me
that
the
3
,
666
people
we
helped
find
jobs
in
1998
earned
approximately
$
49
million
dollars
.
In
addition
to
that
,
by
helping
them
find
jobs
,
Goodwill
reduced
the
state
's
Public
Support
tab
by
an
estimated
$
4
million
.
Your
gift
to
Goodwill
will
help
us
do
even
more
this
year
because
your
gift
will
be
used
to
directly
support
our
work
.
What
kind
of
work
does
Goodwill
do
?
Goodwill
finds
jobs
for
people
with
mental
and
physical
disabilities
.
After
Maureen
's
job
coach
taught
her
how
to
do
her
job
in
a
restaurant
,
we
helped
Maureen
step
out
of
the
shadow
sometimes
cast
over
people
with
physical
and
mental
disabilities
and
find
a
fulfilling
job
smack
dab
in
the
middle
of
society
.
Remember
what
she
said
in
my
last
letter
?
&quot;
If
I
was
n't
working
here
.
.
.
I
would
be
sad
.
.
.
&quot;
Goodwill
helps
people
get
off
of
public
assistance
.
Sherry
learned
through
our
Future
Works
class
that
she
could
rise
out
of
the
mire
of
the
welfare
system
and
support
her
family
.
At
Goodwill
she
gained
in
self-confidence
,
in
her
vision
of
her
future
and
in
the
job
skills
she
needed
to
find
and
keep
a
good
job
.
&quot;
Coming
to
Goodwill
was
the
first
step
toward
my
becoming
totally
independent
.
I
am
now
.
.
.
totally
off
of
welfare
.
&quot;
Goodwill
prepares
people
for
life-long
employment
.
Cornell
found
a
number
of
employment
options
that
he
never
dreamed
existed
after
a
work-site
injury
forced
him
out
of
his
job
at
a
foundry
.
He
trained
in
desktop
publishing
and
combined
his
enthusiastic
work
ethic
with
new-found
skills
in
a
burgeoning
industry
.
&quot;
I
've
got
more
than
a
job
;
I
've
got
a
career
.
&quot;
Goodwill
provides
jobs
at
Goodwill
.
After
a
lifetime
of
trials
,
Donna
not
only
earned
her
GED
at
Goodwill
,
she
earned
a
job
here
.
&quot;
I
rode
a
bike
to
Goodwill
in
the
rain
and
snow
.
I
wanted
to
be
there
.
.
.
I
had
my
second
chance
to
change
my
life
.
&quot;
Your
gift
to
Goodwill
will
help
the
many
people
who
want
to
tell
their
own
stories
of
success
.
Your
support
will
help
them
go
to
work
.
Please
use
the
enclosed
envelope
to
give
a
generous
gift
to
Goodwill
today
!
Sincerely
,
William
A
Carter

Your
gift
is
a
wise
investment
in
the
community
.
For
every
dollar
donated
to
Goodwill
in
1998
,
we
helped
our
&quot;
graduates
&quot;
earn
an
estimated
$
102
.
That
money
was
then
spent
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
adding
fuel
to
our
thriving
economy
.
November

,
1996
Dear
Personal
Donor
:
In
the
short
while
since
Goodwill
helped
him
find
his
job
,
Robert
has
learned
to
thoroughly
clean
a
motel
room
in
about
40
minutes
.
His
job
objectives
call
for
him
to
do
it
in
30
.
He
has
no
time
to
waste
.
Neither
do
we
.
With
the
help
of
friends
like
you
,
Goodwill
has
continued
to
adapt
our
services
to
meet
the
human
needs
of
our
changing
society
.
We
do
n't
waste
time
as
we
are
helping
the
community
.
And
we
do
n't
waste
money
.
The
gift
that
I
am
asking
you
to
make
will
be
used
to
continue
our
mission
of
helping
people
prepare
for
,
find
and
keep
jobs
.
In
their
December
,
1995
review
of
the
nation
's
best
charities
,
U
.
S
.
News
&amp;
World
Report
called
Goodwill
one
of
the
five
&quot;
Standout
Good
Guys
.
&quot;
The
magazine
stated
that
Goodwill
(
as
well
as
the
other
standouts
)
is
&quot;
uniquely
effective
,
innovative
or
valuable
.
&quot;
While
I
appreciate
U
.
S
.
News
&amp;
World
Report
's
endorsement
,
the
true
value
of
your
support
is
measured
by
the
way
Goodwill
takes
on
problems
that
affect
all
of
us
.
Every
time
we
help
someone
find
a
solution
to
their
employment
barrier
,
the
positive
effects
radiate
throughout
our
community
:
The
business
community
welcomes
not
only
another
worker
,
but
a
consumer
with
increased
purchasing
power
.
Parents
act
as
role
models
of
self-sufficiency
instead
of
dependency
.
Tax
dollars
that
would
have
been
spent
on
public
assistance
are
saved
.
You
and
I
know
that
solutions
to
difficult
problems
do
n't
just
happen
.
At
Goodwill
,
it
is
the
hard
work
of
staff
and
those
who
benefit
from
our
services
that
produces
the
kind
of
inspiring
results
I
see
every
day
:
A
Goodwill
staff
member
addresses
a
group
of
welfare
recipients
:
&quot;
You
can
earn
the
money
to
support
yourself
and
your
family
,
&quot;
she
says
.
&quot;
You
can
get
off
welfare
.
I
know
you
can
.
.
.
I
did
.
&quot;
A
participant
in
a
Goodwill
program
rushes
back
from
a
job
interview
to
share
the
results
with
his
classmates
in
our
desktop
publishing
training
program
.
once
his
tears
have
subsided
,
he
confirms
what
his
classmates
have
already
figured
out
:
he
just
received
a
job
offer
-
-
his
first
in
five
years
.
Addressing
a
meeting
at
a
neighborhood
center
,
a
Goodwill
staff
member
tells
the
audience
how
Goodwill
can
help
them
find
and
keep
jobs
.
On
his
way
home
,
he
shares
the
story
with
four
people
at
a
street
corner
.
At
the
next
corner
he
tells
five
more
.
In
order
to
develop
job
skills
,
a
man
with
some
serious
disabilities
begins
working
in
Goodwill
's
industrial
division
.
It
takes
a
long
time
for
him
to
gain
the
self-confidence
to
work
elsewhere
in
the
community
.
Eventually
,
he
turns
your
support
into
a
payoff
for
all
of
us
.
He
proudly
leaves
Goodwill
to
support
himself
.
These
people
and
their
successes
are
real
.
Just
like
the
respect
we
've
earned
from
U
.
S
.
News
&amp;
World
Report
.
Just
like
the
impact
Goodwill
's
work
has
on
our
community
.
Real
work
.
Real
results
.
A
real
difference
in
people
's
lives
-
-
in
all
of
our
lives
.
The
people
who
can
benefit
most
directly
from
your
generosity
have
no
time
to
waste
.
Neither
do
the
rest
of
us
who
feel
the
positive
results
of
their
success
.
Your
support
helps
provide
real
solutions
.
Please

card
and
envelope
to
give
generously
to
Goodwill
today

Dear
Mailhouse
donor
reminder
:
You
and
I
have
done
some
important
work
together
.
We
've
helped
people
break
free
of
the
welfare
cycle
.
We
've
found
ways
for
people
with
disabilities
to
enter
the
workforce
.
We
've
expanded
Goodwill
's
proven
methods
to
towns
and
neighborhoods
where
they
are
needed
most
.
Of
course
,
we
've
played
different
roles
.
You
have
helped
make
Goodwill
's
work
possible
with
your
previous
support
.
Goodwill
has
devised
the
programs
that
turned
your
investment
into
results
.
Who
has
benefited
from
our
partnership
?
Everyone
has
.
When
you
and
I
help
somebody
find
a
job
,
one
more
person
joins
the
ranks
of
tax
payers
,
fewer
tax
dollars
are
spent
on
public
assistance
and
businesses
gain
another
consumer
.
There
are
a
lot
of
barriers
that
keep
people
from
working
:
physical
and
mental
disabilities
,
history
of
welfare
dependency
and
lack
of
education
or
self-esteem
.
And
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
face
these
challenges
every
day
of
their
lives
.
So
our
work
must
continue
.
Everyone
benefits
from
the
work
we
do
together
.
Many
people
need
our
help
.
Please
continue
our
important
partnership
.
Support
Goodwill
with
a
generous
donation

Dear
,
Think
of
your
greatest
accomplishments
.
Think
of
the
joy
and
success
they
bring
to
you
and
your
loved
ones
.
Michael
Sims
felt
that
way
at
age
39
-
-
the
day
he
earned
a
job
.
Michael
was
born
with
cerebral
palsy
.
Upon
entering
the
work
force
,
he
discovered
few
job
opportunities
that
seemed
to
match
his
abilities
.
For
several
years
he
performed
packaging
and
clerical
work
.
His
most
recent
job
lasted
only
a
year
before
cut-backs
eliminated
his
position
.
For
18
long
months
Michael
could
not
find
a
job
.
He
resorted
to
public
assistance
dollars
to
survive
.
Finally
,
Michael
called
Goodwill
.
At
Goodwill
,
Michael
's
counselors
felt
that
his
personable
demeanor
could
be
a
major
attribute
and
identified
for
him
a
possible
job-match
where
his
people
skills
could
shine
.
After
three
interviews
,
Michael
proved
that
he
was
the
right
person
for
the
job
.
As
the
Clubhouse
Monitor
at
Bent
Tree
Apartments
,
he
now
provides
customer
service
for
50
to
60
tenants
each
night
.
At
last
,
he
has
found
success
in
a
job
that
he
loves
.
Now
his
goals
are
set
on
moving
up
in
the
company
.
Every
year
,
thousands
of
people
come
to
Goodwill
.
Like
Michael
,
they
share
two
common
characteristics
.
They
face
some
barrier
to
employment
and
they
want
to
work
.
With
support
from
people
like
you
,
they
can
overcome
their
barriers
and
earn
success
and
the
self-sufficiency
that
comes
with
it
.
And
then
the
pay-off
begins
for
the
entire
community
.
Individual
successes
at
Goodwill
mean
fewer
persons
receiving
public
support
and
more
paying
taxes
.
Last
year
,
participants
in
Goodwill
programs
earned
-
-
and
paid
taxes
on
-
-
wages
of
nearly
$
3
.
5
million
.
Their
successes
at
work
also
saved
taxpayers
more
than
three-quarters
of
a
million
dollars
in
public
assistance
.
The
savings
are
counted
in
more
ways
than
dollars
and
cents
,
however
.
The
families
of
the
new
wage
earners
may
feel
the
accomplishment
in
terms
of
a
house
to
live
in
,
money
to
purchase
food
-
-
without
food
stamps
-
-
and
the
beginning
of
a
family
focused
on
success
,
not
hopelessness
.
Wo
n't
you
help
make
all
of
these
successes
possible
?
Please
send
the
largest
contribution
you
can
comfortably
make
.
Your
gift
will
help
give
new
meaning
to
the
word
success
-
-
for
people
who
have
seldom
had
reason
to
use
the
word
.
Sincerely
,
James
M
.
McClelland
President
P
.
S
.
Your
gift
will
make
a
difference
.
For
every
dollar
of
public
support
Goodwill
received
last
year
,
we
returned
$
1
.
59
to
the
community
in
the
form
of
earned
wages
and
reduced
public
assistance
payments
.
